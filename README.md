# K-O
 This is a game project made with Unity for COMP313-004 Winter 2020 Group 4 Project. The project is currently under development and more features will be added. 

## Game Overview

K-O is a 3D mobile fighting game that aims to provide entertaining and engaging experience to players. It combines elements of classic fighting games with action-adventure games to generate meaningful and fun gameplay. The game consists of three levels. Each level features different types of challenges that the player needs to overcome in order to proceed. 

## How To Open The Project

1. Make sure you are using Unity 2019.2 and have installed Android build support for your Unity version.
2. Download from master branch and unzip the project folder.
3. Open the project folder with Unity and make sure to check the title bar of the Unity Editor window that it indicates Android as the current platform the project is running for.
4. Open the scene you want to check in Assets -> Production -> Scenes folder.
5. When you hit Play to test the game in Unity Editor, since it is a project for Android, only mobile touch inputs on screen can be used. You can use mouse to click on these on-screen inputs to control the character or use Unity Remote on your mobile device to test the game (Instructions on how to use Unity Remote can be found online). 

## How To Run Tests

1. Test codes can be checked in TestSuite.cs under Assets --> Tests folder.
2. To run these tests, open Unity Test Runner, select "Edit Mode", press "Run All" or "Run Selected".
